# Warwick Ultrasound Repository

## Description

This is a repository for code that members of the Ultrasound group at the University of Warwick have written. The idea is that code to control equipment or perform common calculations can be reused, rather than being lost when the person who wrote it leaves. It can additionally be used to host models that have been used to produce research outputs, so that code is openly availible for other researchers to use.

## Requirements for Submission

In order for this to continue to be a useful repository, all submissions must be uploaded with some form of documentation. This should include what the purpose of the submission is, how to use the script/ functions you are uploading, any requirements (e.g. driver installation etc..) and a brief description of how it works if necessary. You should include this in a README.md file (like this one), which can be formatted using a single hash to denote a main title, double hash for level 2 title, etc...

If you don't have time to write proper documentation it's better to submit your code with brief documentation than not at all, but it will be more useful if a proper description of how to use it is provided.
